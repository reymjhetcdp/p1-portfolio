            <p>
              Hi, I’m Reymjhet Cunanan and I have conducted an interview for
              this assessment. I was able to interview a graduating student
              about how her final undergraduate research defense unfolded. At
              first, she said that she didn’t know if she could pull off her
              defense, but surprisingly, all her hard work paid off as her
              panelists were quite impressed with her presentation. I was able
              to learn a lot from her.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, without further ado, here are the tips and tricks I gathered
              that will help you ace your next presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before presenting, of course, you need to know what type of
              presentation you’re giving. This will determine how you should
              speak and act in front of your audience. If you’re giving a thesis
              defense presentation, then you need to be formal with your words
              and actions. If it’s a webinar, you can be flexible. You can be a
              little formal and a little informal, giving your audience reliable
              information or inspiring messages while also being engaging and
              memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, during your presentation, of course, you need to look the
              part. So, your dress code plays an important role in the visuals
              of your audience. The dress code would depend on the type of
              presentation you are giving and the type of audience you are
              presenting to. Wearing flashy clothes may distract your audience
              and make them unable to understand your message.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important thing to take note of would be the allotted time
              for your presentations. Sometimes you will only be given a few
              minutes to present a huge chunk of information. If a presentation
              takes too long, you start to lose your audience. But, if it's too
              short, you might have missed some vital key points. Maximize your
              time by keeping it short and simple, but without jeopardizing the
              quality and content of your presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all know that things may not always go according to plan, but
              that shouldn’t discourage you from giving a good presentation. You
              should always be prepared with a backup plan or be prepared to
              adapt to the situation. For online presentations, a lot can go
              wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most common problem would be technical difficulties such as
              lagging audio or visuals, mic feedback, and so on. Don’t panic,
              just try to provide a quick fix so that you can continue your
              presentation. Always try to be calm and collected. If the fix is
              taking too long, you can try to stall and engage with your
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another possible difficulty would be unexpected interruptions from
              your audiences, especially from panelists. Panelists may ask
              questions while you are still presenting. It may disrupt your
              trail of thought, but you have to persevere. If you need time to
              answer, you can ask for a minute to think of a sound answer.
            </p>
            <p>
              One more important thing to take note of for an online
              presentation, or actually any presentation, is confidence.
              Confidence will always be key to a successful presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last but not the least, if your event is sponsored by an
              organization, it’s a good practice to acknowledge them for giving
              you the opportunity to make your presentation happen. Thanks to
              these people, you are able to convey your message to your target
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the tips and tricks mentioned above, there are
              other factors that can contribute to a successful presentation.
              One of the most important things to consider is the audience.
              Knowing your audience and tailoring your presentation to their
              interests and needs can help you deliver your message effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another important factor to consider is the use of visual aids.
              Visual aids such as graphs, charts, and images can help clarify
              complex information and make your presentation more engaging.
              However, it’s important to use them sparingly and make sure they
              are relevant to your presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Practice is also essential to delivering a successful
              presentation. Practicing your presentation several times can help
              you feel more confident and comfortable when presenting in front
              of an audience. You can also ask friends or colleagues to listen
              to your presentation and provide feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, it’s important to be passionate about your topic. If you
              are passionate about your topic, it will show in your presentation
              and help engage your audience. Your enthusiasm can be contagious
              and inspire others to take an interest in your topic.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, delivering a successful presentation takes
              preparation, practice, and confidence. By following the tips and
              tricks mentioned above, and considering other factors such as the
              audience, visual aids, and passion for the topic, you can deliver
              a memorable and effective presentation. Good luck on your next
              presentation!
